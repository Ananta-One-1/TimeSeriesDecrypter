## Time Series Decrypter
This is an evolutionary algorithm that takes in 2 or more time series, and a unknown weighted summation of them, and return the associated weightages of those time series. A conceptual representation is shown in the figure below:

Unlike Inverse Fourier Transform, this algorithm is capable of resolving weightage of **completely noisy signals**.
